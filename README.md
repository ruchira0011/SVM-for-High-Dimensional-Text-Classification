# SVM-for-High-Dimensional-Text-Classification
This repository contains the code, figures, and written tutorial for a machine-learning project on Support Vector Machines (SVM) for high-dimensional text classification. The work demonstrates how Linear SVMs, combined with TF-IDF representations, achieve strong performance in both binary and multiclass NLP tasks.
